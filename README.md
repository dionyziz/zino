Zino
====
Zino is a greek social network for teenagers developed from 2004 till today.

History
=======
It started as a personal project, by Dionysis Zindros who used the code name of
Chit-Chat for it. It was initially a piece of software to deepen my knowledge
in web technologies. The first version was completed and released in 2 weeks
and evolved into a small community of friends who gathered to discuss latest
news, suggestions and commentary in books, cinema, movies and politics.

It slowly gained popularity and became a place for teenagers to discuss about
news and share opinions in anything. While initially it had a closed circle of
contributors, it was opened to public contribution eventually. Turning from
news- and article-centered to discussion centered, it became a more interactive
place to participate and discuss all subjects from personal matters and hobbies
to religion, love, and politics.

It was later rebranded as Zino and modified to be more user-centered than 
disucssion-centered. The most prominent version of the website was version
Phoenix.

Since its conception, Zino has had over 19,000 members.

In 2012, Dionysis made Zino open source in order to help its further
development and share the technical know-how and research and development
findings we have accomondated through the years.

Technology
==========

We believe most of the source code of Zino is of exceptional software design
quality. It is a prime example of good code organization and software
architecture using traditional as well as state-of-the-art techniques.
The code is generally fast, scalable, and most importantly extensible and
maintainable. We hope publication of this source code will help advance the
field of web development using the technologies we have used.

Most of the code is in PHP. The programming languages used for this project
are HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, C++, XML, XSLT and XPath.
